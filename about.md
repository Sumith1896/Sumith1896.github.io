	Hey there! It seems that you have stumbled on my blog.
</p>

Hello, I am Sumith, a first year Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/).<br/>

My interests are

* **Programming**: I been in love in programming ever since I joined IIT Bombay. I have started contributing to open source at [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html). I have also successfully completed developing apps at appathons conducted at IIT Bombay. I have also developed a couple of webapps.

* **Reading**: I love reading novels. My favourite authors are Dan Brown, Agatha Christie, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to name a few. The genres I like are thrillers and philosophical.
I am also interested in fine arts, sketching and cycling, and occasionally spend time on these too.

That's more about me. I'll keep this updated with my GSoC progress, books that I read and interesting things that I encounter.<br/>
Thanks for reading!
