Hi there! The Google Summer of Code results are out and I have been selected. As mentioned in a previous post, my project of `Implementing polynomial module in CSymPy` has been selected and I get to work with [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org/) under [Python Software Foundation.](https://www.python.org/psf/).

### The excitement

I really thank the community for accepting a freshman do a project. The community over at SymPy is so helpful and the working environment real fun that has motivated me to take up this project.<br/>
My mentors are [Ondřej Čertík](https://github.com/certik) himself and [Sushant Hiray](https://github.com/sushant-hiray), who is a previous GSoC-cer at SymEngine(then CSymPy).<br/>
I'd also like to congratulate [Shivam](https://github.com/shivamvats), [Isuru](https://github.com/isuruf), [Abinash](https://github.com/abinashmeher999) for getting projects under SymEngine and all others who have been selected under SymPy and Python Software Foundations in general.<br/>
I am excited for the summer to follow and the great learning experience ahead.

### SymPy and SymEngine

<img style="float: right" src="/assets/gsoc/sympy.png">

> SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured **[Computer Algebra System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system)** (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible.

> [SymEngine](https://github.com/sympy/symengine) is a fast symbolic manipulation library, written in C++.
Plans to be the fast swappable SymPy core and also a CAS on it's own. We are currently writing Ruby and Julia wrappers for it too.

### The Project

 SymEngine currently lacks a polynomial module which is very essential in achieving SymEngine's goal of being the fastest CAS ever. Having a polynomial module is a core concern and implementing a fast module also help in achieving a fast series module and other modules. Once implemented, SymEngine will be more capable as a fast optional SymPy core which we think is good to ship before 1.0 and at the same time SymEngine becomes a powerful CAS on it's own.

 You can find the proposal [here](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC-2015-Application-Sumith-:-Implementing-polynomial-module-in-CSymPy) for more detailed description of the project.

 Looking forward to a great summer and times to follow. -->
