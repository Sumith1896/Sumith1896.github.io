Hi there! I initially intended to regularly update this blog with my work at EPFL but I was then suggested to not disclose research details of unpublished work. <br> So I worked on a bunch of secretive stuff (shhh!) about which I shall update you soon. I had a blast at EPFL, time at LARA was surely well spent. I now feel more confident about pursuing graduate studies in Computer Science and have decided to do another research intern coming summers, explore a new field or place. I would love to go back to EPFL and Lausanne for grad school, the place is bliss. I'll leave you with the following pictures of my stay at EPFL.. <br>
