Hey, this is my first blog post. I will be applying for Google Summer of Code program 2015 sponsored by Google.
I will be applying for CSymPy/SymPy. I propose to implement polynomial module for CSymPy which forms the core of any Computer Algebra System. Implementing polynomial module in CSymPy will be start for many other implementations. Also this module is guaranteed to be fast getting it more closer to the goal of being the fast optional SymPy.

If selected, I will update this blog to track my progress and get feedback from the community

Good day!
